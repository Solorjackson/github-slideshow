I play various video games on different systems. I used to have an xbox one, of which I use occasially, but for the most part I use my PS5. I am one of the lucky ones that preordered in September and got it to delever through amazon on November 11th, so that was nice. On the PS5 I mostly play 2k21 MyTeam.
