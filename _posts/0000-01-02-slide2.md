I enjoy playing and watching sports. I play basketball and lacrosse. I watch football and basketball a lot. For basketball I am a fan of the **Memphis Grizzlies** and the **Sacremento Kings**. My favorite basketball players are **Ja Morant** and **De'Aaron Fox**. For football I am a fan of the **Jacksonville Jaguars** (sadly). My favorite football player is **James Robinson**.
