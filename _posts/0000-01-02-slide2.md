I enjoy playing and watching sports. I play basketball and lacrosse. I watch football and basketball a lot. For basketball I am a fan of the Memphis Grizzlies and the Sacremento Kings. My favorite players are Ja Morant and De'Aaron Fox. For football I am a fan of the Jacksonville Jaguars (sadly). My favorite player is James Robinson
