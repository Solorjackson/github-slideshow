My real name is Solomon Jackson, but I go by Rocky because of my middle name: "Rock". I have an older bother (Titus) and a younger sister (Esther). My dad owns a business called Jackson Jones Constructions (I work here any chance I get) and they work on retainingwalls, pavers, and other various projects. My mom owns a business called JamiEvent and she plans big events such as weddings (mostly) and other big partys/events.
